# üõç MyStore app

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Project description

This is a simple e-commerce application built with **Angular** as the frontend framework which consumes an API that I built for another Udacity project, which is the [**storefront-backend**](https://github.com/diegolepore/storefront-backend) built with **Node.js** and **PostgreSQL**.

### üîê Register & Sign up
The application has a simple authentication implemented, so in order to add products to the shopping cart and complete the order the user has to be authenticated. So you might have to create an account and then log in.

You could use these testing credentials if you prefer:
```sh
john@test.com
Pass1234
```
